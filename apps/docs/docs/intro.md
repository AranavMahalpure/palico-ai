# Introduction
Improving the accuracy of your LLM application requires running hundreds of experiments to test different combination of LLM models, prompt techniques, prompt context, RAG pipline, and more. Palico streamlines this experimentation by providing an LLM Development Framework that's structures your LLM development for Rapid Experimentation so you can reach your accuracy targets much faster.

The in following section we dig a little bit deeper into the need for streamlining your experimentation process, the role of Palico App plays in your development, and how Palico compares to other frameworks like LangChain. If you would rather jump straight into building, you can get started by following the [installation guide](./getting_started/00_installation.md) or follow the [tutorial](./tutorials/00_intro.md) on building an experiment-driven application.

## The Problem


### Experiment Driven Development

### Typical lifecycle of an LLM Development Team

### Our goal for Development Teams
