# Overview and Setup

## What are we building

In this tutorial we'll create an LLM application that can extract various metadata from a given article. This tutorial has the following phases:

**Phase 1**: We will manually copy-paste the content an article and extract various metadata using different OpenAI models.

**Phase 2**: We will setup a benchmark to continously evaluate the performance of our application as we iterate on it.

**Phase 3**: We will setup an AI Gateway with portkey such that we can experiment with a lot more LLM models.

**Phase 4**: Setup a prompt management system using pug that will let us compare more complex prompts.

**Phase 5**: We will replace the manually copied content with a web scraper that can automatically extract the content of the article given an URL.


## What you will learn

By the end of this tutorial you will know how to:
- Build an LLM application using Palico
- Preview your application using the Palico Playground
- Setup benchmarks and run evaluations to measure performance of your application
- Analyze and compare different variations of your application
- Setup a modular application layer that let's you experiment and iterate on your application
