## Prerequisites

- [Setup a Server-Side Agent](./getting_started.mdx)

## Connecting AgentAPI with React

### Install Palico Client Dependencies

From your React app, install the following package:

```bash title="Terminal"
npm install @palico-ai/client-js @palico-ai/react
```

The `@palico-ai/client-js` package is used to talk to your agent, and the `@palico-ai/react`
package provides a set of React components and tools to make it easy to integrate your agent
into your app.

### Connect to Server-Side Agent

#### Create a Context Provider

From within React, we can use the `PalicoContextProvider` to connect to our agent and send messages to it.
This context provider will handle communicating with the server-side agent and running client-sided tools.
Below is an example of how to add this context provider to your app.

:::note
Replace `<your-service-key>` with the service key you received when you started your server-side agent.
:::

```tsx title="[React]/context/copilot_provider.tsx"
import { createProxyAPIAgentRequestHandler } from "@palico-ai/client-js";
import { PalicoContextProvider } from "@palico-ai/react";

const proxyRequestHandler = createProxyAPIAgentRequestHandler(
  "http://localhost:8000",
  "<your-service-key>"
);

type Props = {
  children: React.ReactNode;
};

export const CopilotProvider: React.FC<Props> = ({ children }) => {
  return (
    <PalicoContextProvider requestHandler={proxyRequestHandler} tools={{}}>
      {children}
    </PalicoContextProvider>
  );
};
```

If you are using the example above, remember to wrap your app with the `CopilotProvider` component.

```tsx title="[React]/app.tsx"
import { CopilotProvider } from "./context/copilot_provider";

const App: React.FC = () => {
  return <CopilotProvider>{/* your existing code */}</CopilotProvider>;
};
```

### Creating a Chat UI

You can either create your own UI to interact with the Copilot, or use the `ChatWidget` component
provided by the `@palico-ai/react` package. For quickly getting started and testing your integrations
with your agent, we recommend using the ChatWidget
component. Below are examples of how to use the ChatWidget component and how to build your own UI.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Built-in Chat Widget" value="chatwidget" default>
    The following example shows you can can create a button that opens the `ChatWidget` component
    when clicked.
    ```tsx title="[React]/component/copilot_button.tsx"
    import { Button } from "@mui/material";
    import { ChatWidget } from "@palico-ai/react";
    import { useState } from "react";

    const CopilotButton: React.FC = () => {
      const [anchorEl, setAnchorEl] = useState<HTMLButtonElement | null>(null);
      const [open, setOpen] = useState(false);

      const handleClick = () => {
        setOpen(true);
      };

      const handleClose = () => {
        setOpen(false);
      };

      return (
        <div>
          <Button
            variant="contained"
            sx={{
              position: "fixed",
              bottom: 16,
              right: 16,
            }}
            ref={setAnchorEl}
            onClick={handleClick}
          >
            Copilot
          </Button>
          <ChatWidget
            width="400px"
            height="600px"
            headerTitle="Chatbot"
            anchorEl={anchorEl}
            open={open}
            onClose={handleClose}
          />
        </div>
      );
    };

    export default CopilotButton;
    ```
    Then you can add the `CopilotButton` component to your app.
    ```tsx title="[React]/app.tsx"
    import CopilotButton from "./component/copilot_button";

    const App: React.FC = () => {
      return (
        <div>
          {/* your existing code */}
          // highlight-next-line
          <CopilotButton />
        </div>
      );
    };
    ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Build your own UI" value="BYOU">
    You can also build your own UI to interact with the Copilot. 
    The `PalicoContext` provides a `sendMessage()` function that allows you to send a message to your agent
    and a `conversationHistory` array that contains the conversation history.
    Here's an example of how you can build your own UI to interact with the Copilot.
    ```tsx title="[React]/component/custom_chat_ui.tsx"
    const CustomChatUI: React.FC = () => {
      // highlight-next-line
      const { conversationHistory, sendMessage } = useContext(PalicoContext)
      
      const handleSendMessage = async (userInput: string) => {
        // highlight-start
        const response = await sendMessage(userInput, {/* context */});
        // highlight-end
      };

      return (
        <div>
          {/* your ui logic*/}
        </div>
      )
    }
    ```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

---

### Testing

You should now have a working Chatbot UI that connects to your Server-sided Agent. Test your chatbot by
sending some messages and see how it responds.

## Adding Tools to your Copilot

The power of a copilot is that it can understand the users intent and take actions on behalf of the user. Tools
are the actions that the copilot can take, such as running a function on the frontend. For Palico, tools
are defined in the server-side agent and implemented in the client-side app.
Here's how you can add tools to your copilot.

### Add tool definitions

From your server-sided agent, navigate to your toolset file (`src/toolset.ts` by default) and define
the inputs and outputs for your tools. Here's an example of a tool that turns on dark mode and subscribes
to a newsletter.

```ts title="[Agent]/src/toolset.ts"
export const AppToolset: Toolset = {
  name: "webapp_toolset",
  tools: [
    {
      name: "turn-on-dark-mode",
      description: "Turns on dark mode for the app",
      input: z.object({
        titles: z.array(z.string()),
      }),
      // No output is needed for this tool
      executionEnvironment: ToolExecutionEnvironment.Client,
    },
    {
      name: "subscribe-to-newsletter",
      description:
        "Subscribes to newsletter. The options are: 'weekly', 'monthly', 'never'",
      input: z.object({
        frequency: z.enum(["weekly", "monthly", "never"]),
      }),
      output: z.object({
        success: z.boolean(),
      }),
      executionEnvironment: ToolExecutionEnvironment.Client,
    },
  ],
};
```

### Connect the tools to your UI

Now from your React app, we want to set the implementation for these tools. Go back to where
defined the `PalicoContextProvider` (in `copilot-provider.tsx`), and add the tool implementations.

```tsx title="[React]/context/copilot_provider.tsx"
type SubscribeToNewsletterParams = {
  frequency: "weekly" | "monthly" | "never";
};

export const CopilotProvider: React.FC<Props> = ({ children }) => {
  const turnOnDarkMode = async () => {
    // ... your implementation to turn on dark mode
  };

  const subscribeToNewsletter = async (params: SubscribeToNewsletterParams) => {
    // ... your implementation to subscribe to newsletter
  };

  // highlight-start
  const tools = {
    "turn-on-dark-mode": turnOnDarkMode,
    "subscribe-to-newsletter": subscribeToNewsletter,
  };
  // highlight-end

  return (
    <PalicoContextProvider
      // highlight-next-line
      tools={tools}
      requestHandler={proxyRequestHandler}
    >
      {children}
    </PalicoContextProvider>
  );
};
```

Now if a user asks to turn on dark mode, the `turnOnDarkMode` function will be called.

## Improving the Prompt

Based on which LLM model you're using, you might not see the result you expect from your Agent. In
this case, you can experiment with the prompt to get better results.

The `PalicoContext` exposes a `sendMessage(message: string, context: Record<string, unknown>)`
function that allows you to send a message to your agent. You can set anything in the `context` object to
be passed to your agent. You will have access to this message and context in your agent's `PromptBuilder`
(`[Agent]/src/prompt_builder.ts`).

If you are using the `ChatWidget` component, you can set the `getSendMessageParams(userInput: string)` to transform
the user input and setting a context before sending it to the agent.

### Changing the System Prompt

Let's change the system prompt to be more strict on how to use tools.

```ts title="[Agent]/src/prompt_builder.ts
export class AppPromptBuilder implements PromptBuilder {
  async getSystemPrompt(params: PromptParamsCommon): Promise<string> {
    return `You're a helpful assistant. You help users accomplish tasks on a website. 
    You have access to tools like "turn on dark mode" and "subscribe to newsletter".
    Once you understand the user's request, you can take actions on their behalf.
    --- RULES TO FOLLOW ---
    - Never make assumptions about the user's intent.
    - Always ask for confirmation before taking any action.
    `;
  }
}
```

With this change, we can enforce how the how the agent interacts with the user.

### Changing the User Prompt

Let's transform the user's input with more context.

NOTE: This is just an example of how you can modify the prompt.
You can make your prompt a lot more complex and dynamic based on your use case.

```ts title="[Agent]/src/prompt_builder.ts
export class AppPromptBuilder implements PromptBuilder {
  async getPromptForQuery(query: string, params: PromptParamsCommon): Promise<string>  {
    return `
      You are asked the following question:
      ================================
        ${query}
      ================================
      ${/* Use Vector Database to retrieve relavant info */}
      You are also given the following context about the state of the website:
        ${params.context}
    `;
  }
}
```

## Trial and Error

Getting the right prompt can be a trial and error process.
You might need to experiment with different prompts to get the best results.
It's recommend finding a systematic way to test and improve your prompts.
We will provide more guidance on this in the future.
