# Getting Started

## Requirements
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)


## Setup Server-Sided Agent

### Create a new Project

```bash
npx palico init <project-name>
```

<details>
<summary>Understanding Directory Structure</summary>

This will create a new directory with the name `<project-name>` and initialize a new Palico project for your.
The project will have a similar directory structure

```
<project-name>
├── src
│   ├── index.ts
|   ├── prompt_builder.ts
|   |── toolset.ts
├── .gitignore
├── .env
├── Dockerfile
├── docker-compose.yml
├── package.json
├── palico.json
|── tsconfig.json
└── README.md
```

- `src/index.ts` - This is the entry point for your server-side agent. You can define the various components of your agent here, 
such as your model config, how to generate prompts, what are the actions your agent can perform, etc.
- `src/prompt_builder.ts` - This is where you define your prompt. You can use the `PromptBuilder` class to define your prompt.
- `src/toolset.ts` - This is where you define the actions your agent can take. You can use the `Toolset` class to define your actions.
- `palico.json` - This is a configuration file on how to build and run your server-side agent. This is used by palico cli tools to
build, run, and deploy your server-side agent.

</details>

### Setting OpenAI Configuration

Open the `.env` file in the root of your project and update your OpenAI configs.
You can get your OpenAI API key from the [OpenAI Dashboard](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys).

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-openai-api-key>
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-3.5-turbo-0125
```

### Start your Server-Side Agent

```bash
npm start
```

You should see a message like the following:

```
Server is running on port 8000
Service key: <some-long-string>
```

Keep the service key handy, you will need it to talk to the server-side agent.
